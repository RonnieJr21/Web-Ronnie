In this internship I have used React.js to modify our front end and build responsive and appealing front end components to aid the users in navigating and using the features we have built. I also have been the primary backend engineer along with working on the frontend. We started off using Flask for our backend, and we had no database connected to our web application, so I decided to change that! I rewrote the backend in Javascript, using Node.js and Express.js and connected everything together using MongoDB. Since then, I have been working on our api and have added user account management, such as creating and deleting, storing and updating in the database. We wanted our application to be secure so each user's account information stored in our database is encrypted, and every user receives JSON web-tokens for the continuous authentication I built into our app. ")),o.a.createElement("hr",{size:"2",noshade:""}),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"USAF"},o.a.createElement("h2",{className:"USAF-Position"},o.a.createElement("a",{className:"USAF-Position-Link",href:"https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/tactical-aircraft-maintenance"}," Tactical Aircraft Maintenance - 2A353E ")),o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"USAF-Time"},"March 2018 - Present"),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"USAF-work"},"I enlisted into the Maryland Air National Guard one month after I turned 18, I was still in high school, I knew I wanted to be a part of something bigger than myself and make an impact in the world. I went to Air force BMT on August 28th 2018 and there I learned a lot about myself and was able some of the closest friendships I could imagine. I put everything I could into being the best Airman I could be and on graduation day I found out that I was the top graduate of my class of 743 other trainees. Nothing in this world will ever beat the feeling earning my Airman's coin and officially earning the title of Airman. My military career has taken me to places I never thought I would ever go. I am an Airforce Mechanic and I work on the A-10C Thunderbolt 2 aka the \"Warthog\" I have been to two airshows, Wisconsin, and Key West all training experience and allowed me to meet new people and see aspects of life I didn't think of before. But, there was a reason I joined the Guard and not Active Duty. I wanted to serve my community, my state, Maryland! I have had the Honor of being able to help the citizens of my state during 2021 and 2022 due to covid. I was on one of the biggest Covid-19 Vaccination stations in Maryland where we administered over 250 Thousand vaccines! I also was called to service again in 2022 With the spike in covid cases I was sent to a testing station where I could help the people coming in know that they will have answers soon and whether they had covid or not. I can not begin to imagine my life had I not joined I have made some of the best friends and memories because of it and I cant wait to see where the Guard takes me!")))}),u=(a(38),a(40),a(42),function(e){var t="card  "+e.className;return o.a.createElement("div",{className:t},e.children)}),h=function(e){var t=e.date.toLocaleString("en-US",{month:"long"}),a=e.date.toLocaleString("en-US",{day:"2-digit"}),n=e.date.getFullYear();return o.a.createElement(u,{className:"expense-date"},o.a.createElement("h3",{className:"date"},t," ",a,", ",n))},p=function(e){return o.a.createElement(u,{className:"expense-item"},o.a.createElement(h,{date:e.date}),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"expense-item__description"},o.a.createElement("h2",null,e.title)),o.a.createElement("div",{className:"expense-item__price"},"$",e.amount))},f=(a(44),a(46),function(e){var t=e.expenses;return o.a.createElement(u,{className:"expenses"},o.a.createElement(p,{title:t[0].title,amount:t[0].amount,date:t[0].date}),o.a.createElement(p,{title:t[1].title,amount:t[1].amount,date:t[1].date}),o.a.createElement(p,{title:t[2].title,amount:t[2].amount,date:t[2].date}),o.a.createElement(p,{title:t[3].title,amount:t[3].amount,date:t[3].date}),o.a.createElement(p,{title:t[4].title,amount:t[4].amount,date:t[4].date}))}),g=function(){var e=[{id:"1",title:"vape juice",amount:17.34,date:new Date},{id:"2",title:"car payment",amount:500,date:new Date},{id:"3",title:"gaming",amount:30,date:new Date},{id:"4",title:"food",amount:127,date:new Date},{id:"5",title:"gamingg",amount:30,date:new Date}];return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"expense-tracker"},o.a.createElement(f,{expenses:e}))},E=(a(48),function(){return o.a.createElement(u,{className:"projects"},o.a.createElement("button",{className:"expense-tracker-link",onClick:function(){window.location.replace("http://localhost:3000/projects/expense-tracker")}},"Expense Tracker"))});var w=function(){return o.a.createElement(l.a,{basename:"/Web-Ronnie"},o.a.createElement(m.c,null,o.a.createElement(m.a,{path:"/",element:o.a.createElement(c,null)}),o.a.createElement(m.a,{path:"/about-me",element:o.a.createElement(d,null)}),o.a.createElement(m.a,{path:"/projects",element:o.a.createElement(E,null)}),o.a.createElement(m.a,{path:"/projects/expense-tracker",element:o.a.createElement(g,null)})))};i.a.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(o.a.createElement(w,null))}],[[18,2,1]]]);
